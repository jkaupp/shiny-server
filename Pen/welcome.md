## What's all this then?

Pen is a reporting writing tool to GRASP (pun intended).  Currently Pen only works for a specific GRASP survey, developed for APSC 200 but there are plans to expand the functionality to the TeamQ survey, as well as other instruments.

## How to use Pen:

1. Select the survey that was run using the GRASP tool. 
2. Click browse to upload the GRASP csv file for the survey results (NOT THE STATUS FILE)
3. Once it's processed the file, you'll see tabs appear.  Each tab allows you to quickly select and review results for each group within the survey.
3. Additionally, you can download PDF reports for your survey. Below the file input you'll see a button appear.  Clicking it will process the reports, then download them to your computer (This can take a moment, so please be patient)
