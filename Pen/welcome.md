## What's all this then?

Pen is a reporting writing tool to GRASP (pun intended).  Currently Pen only works for a specific GRASP survey, developed for APSC 200 but there are plans to expand the functionality to the TeamQ survey, as well as other instruments.

## How to use Pen:

1. Click browse to upload the GRASP csv file for the survey results (NOT THE STATUS FILE)
2. Once it's processed the file, you'll see two tabs activate.  Marks and Comments.  Each tab allows you to quickly select and review marks and feedback for each group.
3. To download a PDF file version of the marks and comment report (each team on a single page), click the appropriate button.
